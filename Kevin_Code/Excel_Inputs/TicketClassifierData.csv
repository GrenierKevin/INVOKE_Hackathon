Got my tools and trash can with sump pump out of my van. Set up the hoses and sump pump. Went to get hot water in the trash can. Could not get a scissor lift in there so I got a ladder and went to check out what was going on. I melted off the ice right where the drain hole was so all the water will go away faster. Noticed that the water was not going away so I checked the drain hole to see if it was plugged. There was nothing blocking the hole so I took apart the pipe for the drain. Once the pipe was out I saw there was a lot of slime/dirt so I cleaned it all out. Put the pipe back on and continued to deice the pan. After all of the ice was gone I also cleaned the evaporator coils with nitrogen and sprayed it with water as well. Cleaned up the area and put everything away. Checked out with Corey.Job complete",Case Cleaning/Deicing

"Travel: 0630-0830On-site: 0830-2030On arrival checked in with store manager. Stated that all cases for rack B are running warm. Went to compressor room and found no compressors running. I immediately got odor of burnt wiring. After investigating found that contactors for comp#1 and #2 were completely fried along with auxiliaries. Checked both compressors for any possible shorts and and found compressor#3 had open windings and compressor needs to be replace. Compressor was still operational condition. Replaced contactor for comp#2. After continuing to troubleshoot found that control voltage breaker was tripped and rested. Once resetting i started up rack except comp#3. Monitored and rack struggled to come down to suction. Saw that compressor 5 for rack was toggled off and check to see if its in operational condition. Compressor was in operational conditions and started up comp. Rack now is holding proper suction. As i am monitoring i noticed that controller had a active low level receiver alarm. Did verify i had no liquid level percentage on indicator and had a flashing sight glass. Leaked checked rack and found no leaks. I then leaked checked store and immediately got hits on my leak detector as soon as i went inside; indicating a big leak. After spending time leak checking I finally located leak at the cat walk of walk in cooler on sys B4. Leak was at the suction pipe. Made repair and leaked checked. No more other leaks found. Picked up 480 lbs of 404a. Rack only took 288lbs of 404a. Will return extra refrigerant.

Found the freezer doors have metal rails that are welded onto the berms that surround the inside of the door. This are in the way of the strip curtains and not allowing them to lay flush against each other. This cause the air to enter the box when ever the door open. This will cause ice over time because you will build sweat on the metal frame. The right hand freezer(LTA3&4) also has a small gap on the bottom of the door. This is from missing concrete. Unless we cut that welded metal piece and level out the concrete and keep the employees from working with the doors open this will be a reoccurring issue. I was able to clear off the ice for now.

Walked inside the cooler and found the Emerson leak detector to be at 0ppm. Grabbed my leak detector and started to walk around inside the cooler and found no leaks, my detector stayed at 0ppm. Removed the Emerson leak detector and did a power cycle on it to reset it. Once it came back on it was still reading 0ppm. I zeroed out the leak detector as well and still was at 0ppm.

The tech said they couldn’t see anything for refrigerant leaks on their end so they said they will have Novar give me a call to see if they can check more in depth. While I was waiting for a call back I started to leak check every unit on the sales floor to see if I picked up any leaks and I didn’t find any. After 40 minutes Novar called me back.

"Deice dairy coolerChecked in with MarkLet him know we were here to deice the evaporators in the dairy coolers units C8-C13. Asked if we could have some of the pallets moved from the middle of the cooler. He said he will send someone to move them for us. Got the scissor lift and moved them in the dairy cooler. Went to my van and got my trash can and sump pump with hoses. Set up the hoses and went to get hot water in my trash can. Once everything was set up we checked each evaporator to see which ones needed to be Deiced. Evaporator C8, C9 and C12 had ice on both sides of the unit. Started by deicing unit C12 first, as we were spraying water on the coils there was water dripping on the floor so we went to get a big container so the water would fall in there. As water fell in the container some would still splash on the floor so we went to get a mop and bucket. As one of us sprayed water in the ice the other one would mop up the water that would get on the floor so customers would t slip with the water. Once done with that unit we moved over to C8 and did the same thing. Unit C9 was the worse one with a lot of ice on both sides. As we Deiced the evaporators we had to keep going for more hot water so we can clear out all of the ice. After melting all of the ice we moved out the scissor lift and cleaned up all of the puddled water on the floor.

Forced the pharmacy unit into test mode to verify the cooling stage was working. Checked amp draw on the compressor then verified the condenser fans were running and had good airflow. Called Novar and requested the look into the system for issues. Novar found the outside air temp sensor was reading 0 degrees and keeping the units from running. The sensor was then overridden to read 80 degrees. Monitored operation and all units began to run. Monitored operation of the pharmacy and the space temp quickly dropped from 81 degrees to 72. Checked the HVAC controllers to try and find the issue with the outside air temp. Reset the opus controller then looked for a connection for the outside air temp. Found the units are all reading outside air temp on their own rather than just one unit sending the info to the controller. The units are running well except for some which are not reading a space temp, this issue will be resolved on another work order. Will need to return to figure out the OTS issue.

"8/3/2023 4:11:33 PM Hooper, Zackery -0001 8/3Checked in with manager. High temperatures at casing was caused from issues at the rack Found that all the compressors were locked out on oil failure due to low oil levels. Added 1 gallon of oil to rack and made sure oil level was above the first sight glass in the reservoir. Reset controller and got the rack back on. All compressors ended up tripping on high discharge due to dirty condenser. Cleaned condensers and was able to lower discharge pressure and got compressors 2,3,&4 back up and running Compressor 1 is down and is having internal mechanical issues. Got with Jim Mortel and he instructed me to isolate the compressor and he will follow up to further diagnose. All circuits are back down to set-points and pressures and temperatures at the rack are within proper ranges .The repairs were made on work order 230802-0231. Followed up on 8/3 to make sure circuit is reaching set-point temperature.",Compressors/Motors

Arrived on site to work on bunker case leaking water I checked in with manager to let them know what I was doing then I went to the case and pulled the bottom of the case to access the drain and I had them pull a section of the case so I can get to the drain pan once they moved it all I removed the shelves and the fan motor and saw the drain pain had been rusting out and is leaking thru little holes so I talked to the manager and ask if they wanted to shut it off for a day and let it dry out so we can seal the pan but they said the remodel gets started on the store in a month so don’t worry about the pan,Case Cleaning/Deicing

History showed someone had changed it to 68F some months ago and then it was changed back by corporate. I checked pressures to ensure it wasn’t low on refrigerant.

I spent 3-4 hours on the phone with sams club/novar reprogramming controls and re-syncing all circuits that were out on com loss. Also found that the defrost schedule was set on all circuits on mtc to 6 times a day with terminations temps set to 55 degrees and defrost length was set at 40 minutes for each defrost. Had sams club program defrost to 4 times a day for 30 minutes with a defrost termination temp at 45 degrees. Was able to get rack back up and running and made sure all circuits were reaching set-points. Once all compressor came back on I was having issues with liquid flood-back to the compressors. Due to rack being down for so long it caused liquid to stack in the oil reservoir causing compressors to go out on oil failure. Got on the phone with David G. To get some insight on getting liquid out of oil reservoir. He had me isolate compressor 3 which was the main compressor having the most liquid flood back. I allowed comp 1&4 to cycle refrigerant through the system and was eventually able to remove the liquid from oil reservoir and out of compressors. Opened valves back up on comp 3 and allowed system to run for an hour to ensure there would not be anymore oil failures or issues with high temps at the circuits.

B-19 case hi temping at 41° and LT-SC IC DRS high temping at 8°F. Started with the LT-SC IC DRS case to make sure product was not in danger. After further investigation, found that there are two cases/circuits that are labeled the same one is under rack B the other one is under rack A. After calling Novar found that rack A circuit controls the RCU unit on top of the roof that controls the actual ice cream doors behind the three main POS freezers and cooler. After further investigation in order to find the second circuit due to nothing being labeled. Finally, after going through the store was able to find that the curb side pick up Freezer is the one labeled under rack B. Labeled the case above the temp controller on case for both cooler and freezer. Case is iced up and getting very little airflow and temping currently at 6°FCase LT-SC IC DRSSelf contained Brand -HeatcraftModel -QIV5V14-03AMUNSerial -C16B01356After diagnosing, the unit found that the condenser was extremely packed and could not have airflow through the coils, causing the refrigerant not to condense properly and causing icing issues on the evaporator coil, due to flood back. Once condenser coil was cleaned properly and blown out with CO2 due to the case, being a self-contained and not being able to deice properly using a hose and water in fear of flooding, spoke with manager and decided to turn off the case while further diagnosing other cases that are temping incorrectly. Opened all the doors removed the panels and allowed Ambient temperature to penetrate case in order to defrost naturally. Let case defrost and checked the heating element operation and the programming based on manufacturing specs and everything was running good just the issue with the condenser being dirty seems to be the only issue with the case. Turned case back on before leaving and running through another defrost cycle and gave the manager the all clear of case is at temp in the morning to start using. Started further diagnosing circuit B-19 caseBrand -HeatcraftModel -DX6XN-08RUNSerial -C16A00839Case has multiple work orders opened under this issue that was quoted for work to be done called Novar and was going over case programming and controls. Found case was completely iced up and had no airflow at all. Started deicing and going over controls and setpoints with novar. After case was deiced started checking valves and superheats after further investigation and checking with previous technicians found that the case needs new TXVs that were already ordered. Making sure defrost and everything was working properly will complete parts install on work order 230801-0310 and TN 252496960.Started going over the B-13 case which is high temping as well at 90°F. B-13 case is the MD Pizza case located in front of the cafe. Case controller upon initial look over is at 29°F which is the setpoint for this case. Started taking apart the case to further diagnose, found that the honeycombs were extremely dirty and needed to be blown out and can cause lack of airflow. Found case was temping properly, but not showing correctly on Novar rack controller for circuit monitoring.Brand -HussmannModel -?2???6XESerial -?000162142Started taking apart panels and tracing temp sensor making sure there’s no disconnect. Case module is reading proper case temperature but monitoring is still reading 90°F. How to take apart drain line and bottom of case in order to access 1081 opus controller. Did not find any issues with sensor or terminal points. Going back-and-forth between electrical room controller back to case found that under rack control monitoring, case sensor is reading properly at 29.7°F but control temp is reading 90°F with sensor fault possible that case control board is bad.

Labeled the case above the temp controller on case for both cooler and freezer. Case is iced up and getting very little airflow and temping currently at 6°FCase LT-SC IC DRSSelf contained Brand -HeatcraftModel -QIV5V14-03AMUNSerial -C16B01356After diagnosing, the unit found that the condenser was extremely packed and could not have airflow through the coils, causing the refrigerant not to condense properly and causing icing issues on the evaporator coil, due to flood back. Once condenser coil was cleaned properly and blown out with CO2 due to the case, being a self-contained and not being able to deice properly using a hose and water in fear of flooding, spoke with manager and decided to turn off the case while further diagnosing other cases that are temping incorrectly. Opened all the doors removed the panels and allowed Ambient temperature to penetrate case in order to defrost naturally. Let case defrost and checked the heating element operation and the programming based on manufacturing specs and everything was running good just the issue with the condenser being dirty seems to be the only issue with the case. Turned case back on before leaving and running through another defrost cycle and gave the manager the all clear of case is at temp in the morning to start using. Started further diagnosing circuit B-19 caseBrand -HeatcraftModel -DX6XN-08RUNSerial -C16A00839Case has multiple work orders opened under this issue that was quoted for work to be done called Novar and was going over case programming and controls. Found case was completely iced up and had no airflow at all. Started deicing and going over controls and setpoints with novar. After case was deiced started checking valves and superheats after further investigation and checking with previous technicians found that the case needs new TXVs that were already ordered. Making sure defrost and everything was working properly will complete parts install on work order 230801-0310 and TN 252496960.Started going over the B-13 case which is high temping as well at 90°F. B-13 case is the MD Pizza case located in front of the cafe. Case controller upon initial look over is at 29°F which is the setpoint for this case. Started taking apart the case to further diagnose, found that the honeycombs were extremely dirty and needed to be blown out and can cause lack of airflow. Found case was temping properly, but not showing correctly on Novar rack controller for circuit monitoring.Brand -HussmannModel -?2???6XESerial -?000162142Started taking apart panels and tracing temp sensor making sure there’s no disconnect. Case module is reading proper case temperature but monitoring is still reading 90°F. How to take apart drain line and bottom of case in order to access 1081 opus controller. Did not find any issues with sensor or terminal points. Going back-and-forth between electrical room controller back to case found that under rack control monitoring, case sensor is reading properly at 29.7°F but control temp is reading 90°F with sensor fault possible that case control board is bad. Called novar after resetting opus controller and waiting the time for case to reset. Once case reset correct temp came up on the rack monitoring. Made sure case continued to operate correctly and updated manager call is complete",Case Cleaning/Deicing
